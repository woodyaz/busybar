# BusyBar

## Synopsis

A standalone desktop app built on Electron to let folks no if you're free for interuption.

## Example

@TODO Add Screenshots/Animated something or other.

## Motivation

I tend to get a lot of "drive-bys" at my cube location.  It's usually not a big deal but sometimes I really need to focus on a project.  I wanted to see if I could come up with a nice way to let folks know that ~~they can piss right off until I'm ready~~ I'm currently busy or I'm free for conversation.

Plus Electron looked neat, so here we are.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo.
  `git clone https://github.com/woodyaz/busybar.git`
2. Run `npm install`
3. `npm start`

## To Do

* DRY up the code -  My javascript is super gross at the moment.

* Unit tests! - I haven't done TDD with node/javascript yet.  Could be fun.  Could cause me to light my hair on fire.

* Incoporate a timer function.  Pomodoro anyone?

* Add options for busy/free text and colors.

* ~~Have another beer.~~
